# Emmere 
This repo contains source code for a PyTorch machine learning model classifies images of Ugandan foods. 
Emmere means `food` in Luganda, a local language in Uganda.


## Why we created Emmere
In Uganda, which is the Pearl of Africa and the tourist hotspot in East Africa, there are many local foods that are not well known to the world. 
The hope is that this machine learning model is that it shall accelerate nutritional related research in Uganda and the world at large by providing a way to classify images of Ugandan foods.
